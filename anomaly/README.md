**PREDICT PUMPED COINS**

Using Random Forest algorithm to predict if a coin is going to be pumped, given that information about all necessary 
features are available.

Some important features include:
- Pumped before: has the coin been pumped before
- Pumped times: how many times the coin has been pumped
- Hourly price: hourly price
- Return volumn: return volume over different periods of time
- Cap: market cap of the coin
- Age: age of the coin
- And more

Two Random Forest models were created, trained and tested, with the main difference lies in the number of trees involved in each
model. The data was split into training and test data with different ratios, so they can be applied by different models.
Cross validation was also applied so we can minimize the effect of overfitting. Moreover, stratification was also necessary
due to the nature of the dataset, which is heavily imbalanced with the number of FALSE labels (i.e. not pumped) is way higher
than the number of TRUE labels (i.e. pumped)

Important functions include:
- load_pump_data()
- split_data()
- train_rf_model()
- get_pump_prediction()
- and more

More information about these functions can be found in the implementation.

## Fifth labor problem - Merging behavior
fifth_labor_problem.py aims to  find out all the suspicious nodes starting from a dataset that contains a set of known suspicious nodes.
We have called the original API(https://blockchain.info/) to illustrate the result from real data. Data file contains ~20K initial suspicious addresses, range(1000) is used instead of range(len(date)) for demonstration.
- Problem1: If an address receives multiple payments (i.e. merge address) then it is regarded suspicious.\
    Simply run fifth_labor_problem1()\
    Demonstration: \
    Computation takes ~21mins(1252secs), found 1202 merging addresses including
    {'1DxZGpmCwRUTeb5g1za1CJ2mcFK5w6f69M', '1JzvWfkKhmDzVweYLkpiaZi7D8zG6XBg5E', '1BrqDeueryM4b4mpzrxvf7Txs15eiqYRRk'...}
    and also 4 exchange addresses.
    This method will generate merging_addresses.txt and to see if these merging addresses contain
    any exchange addresses(which is not malicious) run check_exchange_address().

- Problem2: If multiple addresses merge after N block, then the merging address is suspicious.\
    We simplified problem into 1 to 1 and 1 to 2 transaction only and within 3 hops
    Run fifth_labor_problem2()\
    Demonstration: \

    | Hops  | Time(seconds) | Merging address count  |
    | ------|:-------------:| ----------------------:|
    |      1|            677|                       0|
    |      2|           1843|                       3|
    |      3|           4677|                      26|
    
    Run check_exchange_address()\
    We did not see any exchange addresses in the result.\
    Considering 2 hops, we found {'14mhJHmj25kAiBDpUd3hord9Wm694CxEDn', '1dice97ECuByXAvqXpaYzSaQuPVvrtmz6', '1diceDCd27Cc22HV3qPNZKwGnZ8QwhLTc'}
    and last two addresses are known to be the address of gambling company. Moreover, in 3 hops, there are some bank addresses.\
    It is hard to test more than 3 hops as the computation time grows exponentially(find it in the table).\
    Note: generate_exchange_addresses() is preprossing method to generate exchange_addresses.txt
