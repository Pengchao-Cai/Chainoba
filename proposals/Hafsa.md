# Project proposal
## Group: Visualization
The goal of my project is to visualize data. The data will be derived from previous groups.
### Answers to questions
1. What is your group, what are your considered articles?
Group: Visualization
Considered articles: (i) Bitconeview: visualization of flows in the bitcoin transaction graph, Di Battista. (ii) Visualizing dynamic bitcoin transaction patterns, McGinn
2. What is the aim in your project? What algorithms will you implement? 
The aim of this project is to visualize the flow and pattern of data. I have to explore various visualization libraries for data visualization. 
3.	What type of data do you require from the database, on which blockchain? 
The data will come from the other groups. It should be bitcoin data. 
4.	What will be your results about? Addresses, transactions, blocks, clusters, etc.? 
The results provide a visualization of bitcoin transaction in graphs. Careful measures will be taken to present the transaction clearly so that any user can get useful idea about bitcoin transaction. The visualizations should be scalable to the screen. 
5.	Are your results time dependent? A time dependent result is valid for a specific time period. For example, degree centrality of an address can be computed daily. 
Yes. Visualization will be specified for a particular span of time as it varies over time.  
6.	What do we need to store from your results? (for example, the fact that “address a appears in the same cluster with address b” can be stored). 
Results will be stored as graph. 
7.	What are your findings that can be visualized by the visualization group?
8.	Can your results be used as input in the algorithms of other groups? (this estimate will be updated after you see algorithms that are being implemented by others) 
Since visualization is the final step, results from this step will not be applicable for other groups.
