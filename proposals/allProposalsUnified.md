## Baha 
Data: Bitcoin
Aim: Given an address, find other addresses owned by the owner of the address. Will implement 1) co-spending and 2) transitive closure and 3) change address heuristics. 
Results to store: co-clustered addresses. 
Results to visualize: Set of addresses and their edges (colored).

## Dilawer
Data: Ethereum
Aim: Find k-cores of addresses in token networks.
Results to store: temporal core values of addresses.
Results to visualize: Set of addresses, their edges and core regions (see Dilawer's proposal)

## Gaganpreet
Data: Bitcoin or Ethereum
Aim: Find mint and entropic centrality of an address over all time, or over a time period.
Results to store: (temporal) centrality value of an address.
Results to visualize: Set of addresses, their edges and (centrality dependent) colored addresses.

## Gurnoor
Data: Bitcoin, price data from exchanges (CCXT library)
Aim: Find pump and dump addresses and transactions.

Results to visualize: Addresses and their edges.

## Joglas
Data: Bitcoin
Aim: Ripple measurement study

## Karan
Data: Ethereum smart contracts
Aim: Detecting Smart Contract Ponzi schemes.
Results to store: Smart Contract, address and transaction information.
Results to visualize: A network of smart contracts and their relationships as edges?

## Mario: Foundation team. Deployment.

## Matthias
Data: Ethereum.
Aim: Conflicts with Gaganpreet a bit. Matthias may need to compute Betweenness, Shortest path and other classical centrality measures on token networks.
Results to store: centrality values of addrresses and contracts (centrality of a contract is an interesting idea. May be connected to Karan's work).
Results to visualize: Set of contracts, addresses, their edges and (centrality dependent) colored addresses.

## Roya: Visualization. 

## Saad:
Data: It is better to use Ethereum for k-means.
Aim: Create (within a time window) k-means clustering of addresses in token networks.  Need to implement one more clustering. K means is too basic for this course.
Results to store: co-clustered addresses. 
Results to visualize: Set of addresses and their edges (colored).

## Mamun 
Data: Ethereum.
Aim: TOken classification based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation

## Sourav
Data:Bitcoin
Aim: Implement BitcoinHeist in python, and create R binings for TDAMApper. (Code is in Java, needs to be cleaned and converted.)
Results to store: Ransomware addresses, and families.
Results to visualize: A flow of bitcoins between addresses.

## Wodi
Data: Bitcoin
Aim (well written): Compute the Levenshtein distance algorithm to measure similarities between addresses to merge them. Then, by using the Wagner-Fischer’s algorithm, generate a matrix of distances between the addresses. Subsequently, use the Ward’s method to cluster the addresses.
Results to store: address clusters
Results to visualize: addresses, their clusters in color.
