* <b> What is your group, what are your considered articles? </b>

	- Group name: Graph Analytics
	- Articles:
		- Forecasting Bitcoin Price with Graph Chainlets, Akcora
        - Understanding Ethereum via Graph Analysis,Chen
        - Quantitative Analysis of the Full Bitcoin Transaction Graph,Ron
        - The Graph Structure of Bitcoin, Damiano Di Francesco Maesa
        
 * <b> What is the aim in your project? What algorithms will you implement?</b>

	- Aim of the project is graph analytics on Bitcoin data considering 	
	  addresses and transaction data collectively.
    - Performing the following graph analytics:
    
    	- Chainlets of time period
		- Number of Strongly connected graph/Weakly connected Graph
		- Node Identity
		- Total bitcoins received from an address
		- Level of Activity
 * <b> What type of data do you require from the database, on which blockchain? </b>
	- Data required: Address(Input and output) and transaction(amount transferred)to generate graphs with chainlets on Bitcoin blockchain.

* <b> What will be your results about? Addresses, transactions, blocks, clusters,etc.? </b>

	- A graph with chainlets and different graph metrics.
	
* <b> Are your results time dependent? A time dependent result is valid for a
specific time period. For example, degree centrality of an address can be
computed daily. </b>

	- Yes, the results are time dependent. The number of chainlets generated at a specific period of time and also the total bitcoins received from an address at a specific period of time.

* <b> What do we need to store from your results? (for example, the fact that
“address a appears in the same cluster with address b” can be stored).</b>

	- Details that can be stored are:
		- The details of different chainlets generated
		- Node Identity details
* <b> What are your findings that can be visualized by the visualization group? </b>

	-The following findings should be visualized by visualization team:
    	
        - The time series representation of different chainlets
        - Number of Strongly connected graph/Weakly connected Graph
        - Node Identity
        - Total bitcoins received from an address
        - Level of Activity

* <b> Can your results be used as input in algorithms of other groups? (this
estimate will be updated after you see algorithms that are being
implemented by others) </b>
	
    - Yes, the results can be used by Visualization team and Influence team.
