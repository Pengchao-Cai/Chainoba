 -   What is your group, what are your considered articles?
	 - Group: Anomaly Detection
	 - I've considered the following articles:
		 - To the moon: defining and detecting cryptocurrency pump-and-dumps 
		 - The Anatomy of a Cryptocurrency Pump-and-Dump  
		 - Extortion graph exploration techniques in the bitcoin network
		 - BitcoinHeist: Topological data analysis for ransomware detection on the Bitcoin blockchain  
		 - Tracking Ransomware End-to-end  
		 - Exploiting Blockchain Data to Detect Smart Ponzi Schemes on Ethereum  
		 - The Fifth Labor - The Concept
    
 -   What is the aim in your project? What algorithms will you implement?
	 - This project aims to use certain indicators in order to locate crypto pump & dump fraud problem using an anomaly detection approach. This will be done in the following steps:

		 1. Obtaining the  exchange data from a variety of cryptocurrency exchanges.
		 2. Using breakout indicators, such as volume and price, as well as reinforcers, such as number of exchanges and market cap to locate a crypto pump & dump.
		 3. Attempt to detect some pump and dump addresses and transactions from the Bitcoin database.
    
 -   What type of data do you require from the database, on which blockchain?
	 - Exchange data from a variety of cryptocurrency exchanges. This data can be obtained from the [CCXT](https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt) library. Transaction and address data would also be required from the Bitcoin database.
    
 -   What will be your results about? Addresses, transactions, blocks, clusters, etc.?
	 - The results will be the detection of a crypto pump and dump scheme along with some pump and dump addresses and transactions.
    
 -   Are your results time dependent? A time dependent result is valid for a specific time period. For example, degree centrality of an address can be computed daily.
	 - The results are will not be time dependent for this project.
    
 -   What do we need to store from your results? (for example, the fact that “address a appears in the same cluster with address b” can be stored).
	 - The addresses and transactions associated with the pump and dump scheme will need to be stored from the results.
    
 -   What are your findings that can be visualized by the visualization group?
	 - The pump and dump addresses and transactions can be visualized by the visualization group.
    
 -   Can your results be used as input in algorithms of other groups? (this estimate will be updated after you see algorithms that are being implemented by others)
	 - The results can be used as an input by the visualization team.
