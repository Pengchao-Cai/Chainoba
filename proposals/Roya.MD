# Individual project proposal

Group: **Visualization**. My role is to visualize the output data from other groups.
  

# Answers to questions
*  **What is your group, what are your considered articles?**
Article: BitIodine: Extracting Intelligence from the Bitcoin Network. Biva: bitcoin network visualization and analysis

* **What is the aim in your project? What algorithms will you implement?**
Article: Our aim is to visualize the output of other groups. So, our main focus is on learning Python visualization libraries.

* **What type of data do you require from the database, on which blockchain?**
Our input data will be the output of the information from other groups.

* **What will be your results about? Addresses, transactions, blocks, clusters, etc.?**
Results will be about visualizing the transactions and graphs so that it is comprehensible to the mind and appealing to the eye.

* **Are your results time dependent? A time dependent result is valid for a specific time period. For example, degree centrality of an address can be computed daily.**
Yes, the results will be time-dependent as the visualization varies based on time.

* **What do we need to store from your results? (for example, the fact that “address a appears in the same cluster with address b” can be stored).**
Maybe the desired graph with particular properties is required to be stored.

* **What are your findings that can be visualized by the visualization group?**

* **Can your results be used as input in the algorithms of other groups? (this estimate will be updated after you see algorithms that are being implemented by others)**
No, we implement the final module which is visualization.
 

 
Code: Algorithms and functions that I will implement.
`<store>` is a typical example.
