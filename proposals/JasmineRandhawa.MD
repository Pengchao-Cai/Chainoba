# My Contribution

My contribution in foundations team is mainly creating endpoints for API methods:
1.	Writing and testing code for 3 individual api end points one for Transaction input and one for transaction Output and one for Output addresses. 
2.	Providing above individual end points for integration with Transaction level data endpoint. (in collaboration with Mario and Mahesh)
3.	Designed and Wrote code to link address information to various transaction outputs and to link transaction outputs to the transaction Ids thereby returning the nested response for Transaction Outputs API method.
4.	Updated Postman project with sample requests for API methods.
5.  Code cleanups 
6.  Logging and Exceptional Handling
7.  Api Documentation updations
8. Writing code for Ethereum ApI for external transactions and Ponzy scheme data
