**Individual Project Proposal**

##### What is your group, what are your considered articles?

Clustering group

  

Articles

·    Clustering Blockchain Data (survey paper)

·    Tracing Transactions Across Cryptocurrency Ledgers, Meiklejohn

·    A fistful of bitcoins: characterizing payments among men with no names, Meiklejohn.

·    Clustering in weighted networks (survey paper).

I will only be presenting on the second article in the above list. (as we are not going to work on ledger for the whole project)

But I will work on clustering Ethereum addresses and transactions. 

  

##### What is the aim in your project? What algorithms will you implement?

The aim of the project is to cluster blockchain data. The main idea here is to combine addresses that belong to a particular vendor/merchant.

I am going to use the idea of  "K means clustering" and "Silhouette Analysis" for implementation.

##### What type of data do you require from the database, on which blockchain?

The network data of Ethereum addresses and transactions are required for the analysis of Ethereum blockchain.

##### What will be your results about? Addresses, transactions, blocks, clusters, etc.?

The result will be cluster of similar types of  addresses and transactions of Ethereum blockchain.

##### Are your results time dependent? A time dependent result is valid for a specific time period. For example, degree centrality of an address can be computed daily.

No, it is not time dependent.

##### What do we need to store from your results? (for example, the fact that “address a appears in the same cluster with address b” can be stored).

Need to store the lists of the clusters of different addresses and transactions. 

##### What are your findings that can be visualized by the visualization group?

The visualization group needs to visualize the clusters with their details.

##### Can your results be used as input in algorithms of other groups? (this estimate will be updated after you see algorithms that are being implemented by others)

The results will be used by the visualization team and may be used by the anomaly detection team to detect suspicious cluster.
