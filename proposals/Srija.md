# Individual Project Proposal 
#### -Srija Srivastava

* __What is your group, what are your considered articles?__
	* Group: Graph Analytics
	* Articles: Quantitative Analysis of the Full Bitcoin Transaction Graph; The Graph Structure of Bitcoin; Understanding Ethereum via Graph Analytics; Forecasting Bitcoin Price with Graph Chainlets.
* __What is the aim in your project? What algorithms will you implement?__
	* Aim of my project is to analyse the Bitcoin system using graphs.
	* I will be evaluating the following graph metrics: 
		* Assortativity coefficient
		* Correlation degree
		* Address distribution 
		* Current balance per address
		* Transaction size 
* __What type of data do you require from the database, on which blockchain?__
	* To carry out the analysis, I would need all the details of transactions of Bitcoin system which may include input addresses, output addresses and payment amount. 
* __What will be your results about? Addresses, transactions, blocks, clusters, etc.?__
	* It will be about graph metrics.
* __Are your results time dependent? A time dependent result is valid for a specific time period. For example, degree centrality of an address can be computed daily.__ 
	* Yes, the analysis of distribution of current balance per address is date dependent.
* __What do we need to store from your results? (for example, the fact that “address a appears in the same cluster with address b” can be stored).__
	* Statistical distribution of address, current balance, transaction size
	* Assortativity and correlation degree 
* __What are your findings that can be visualized by the visualization group?__
	* Statistical distribution of address of addresses
	* Distribution of current balance of each address in the bitcoin system
	* Distribution of transaction size of each transaction carried out between addresses
	* Assortativity and correlation degree of bitcoin system
* __Can your results be used as input in algorithms of other groups? (this estimate will be updated after you see algorithms that are being implemented by others)__
	* The result can be used by visualization team.
