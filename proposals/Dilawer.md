## Paper - Incremental _k_-core decomposition: algorithms and evaluation
**Group**: Influence

**Role**: Implement Incremental Decomposition Algorithm for Dynamic Graph Data

---

### **What is the aim of your project?**
>Among the several k-core decomposition algorithms suggested, implement one such on a given graph, and analyze the partitions at different layers from a external to a more central viewpoint.


### **What type of data do you require from the database, on which blockchain?**

>Transactions (Including Amount) & Addresses (Input/Output) on Bitcoin or Ethereum Blockchain

### **What will your results be about?**

>A graph with different layer decompositions on a Blockchain.

### **Are your results time dependent? A time dependent result is valid for a specific time period. For example, degree centrality of an address can be computed daily.**

> No

### **What do we need to store from your results?**

> Nothing in terms of usable data.

### **What are your findings that can be visualized by the visualization group**

> The Visualization can possibly color code the different layers at each k-core level.

### **Can your results be used as input in algorithms of other groups?**

The results of this algorithm will be given to the Visualization Team to graph.
