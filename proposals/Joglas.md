# COMP 7570 - Blockchain Analysis - Project Proposal

<b>1. What is your group, what are your considered articles?</br></b>
Anomaly Detection. I will use the following articles:

<b>2. What is the aim in your project? What algorithms will you implement?</br></b>
The aim of my project is to track malicious activities, in this case ransomwares payments. Due to time constraint, I will focus on one or two families of ransomware. I will also try to create clusters for addresses that are somehow associated with the ransom addresses (e.g. co-spending).

***

<b>3. What type of data do you require from the database, on which blockchain?</br></b>
I need transactions (input/output addresses).

***

<b>4. What will be your results about? Addresses, transactions, blocks, clusters, etc.?</br></b>
Addresses and clusters.

***

<b>5. Are your results time dependent? A time dependent result is valid for a specific time period. For example, degree centrality of an address can be computed daily. </br></b>
It is not time dependent.

***

<b>6. What do we need to store from your results? (for example, the fact that “address a appears in the same cluster with address b” can be stored). </br></b>
Association between cluster and addresses.

***

<b>7. What are your findings that can be visualized by the visualization group? </br></b>
Clusters.

***

<b>8. Can your results be used as input in algorithms of other groups? (this estimate will be updated after you see algorithms that are being implemented by others) </br></b>
Not sure yet.
