##### What is your group, what are your considered articles?
Clustering group

***
###### Articles 
- Clustering Blockchain Data (survey paper)

- Tracing Transactions Across Cryptocurrency Ledgers, Meiklejohn

- A fistful of bitcoins: characterizing payments among men with no names, Meiklejohn.

- Clustering in weighted networks (survey paper).

I will be working on the third article in the above list.

##### What is the aim in your project? What algorithms will you implement?
The aim of the project is to cluster blockchain data. The idea is to tag addresses that belong to a particular vendor/merchant 
- K means clustering 

##### What type of data do you require from the database, on which blockchain?
The data of bitcoin addresses and transactions based on amount are required for the analysis of bitcoin blockchain

##### What will be your results about? Addresses, transactions, blocks, clusters, etc.?
The result would be to cluster blockchain addresses based on different transactions 

##### Are your results time dependent? A time dependent result is valid for a specific time period. For example, degree centrality of an address can be computed daily.
No, it is not time dependent. 

##### What do we need to store from your results? (for example, the fact that “address a appears in the same cluster with address b” can be stored). 
Need to store details of the transaction  in order to the clustering co-efficient, bitcoin in circulation, Maximal Balance(address), The most active entity.

##### What are your findings that can be visualized by the visualization group? 
The visualization group need to visualize the clustering co-efficient.

##### Can your results be used as input in algorithms of other groups? (this estimate will be updated after you see algorithms that are being implemented by others)
Our results will be used by the visualization team and may be used by influence team.
