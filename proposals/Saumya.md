# Individual Project Proposal 
##### -Saumya Omanakuttan

##### What is your group, what are your considered articles?
The group - Graph Analytics <br />
Articles :<br />
* Quantitative Analysis of the Full Bitcoin Transaction Graph, Ron.<br />
* The Graph structure of Bitcoin, Di Francessco<br />
* Forecasting Bitcoin Price with Graph Chainlets, Akcora

##### What is the aim in your project? What algorithms will you implement?
The aim of the project is to design a transaction-address graph which would be used for analysis of the following graph metrics :<br />
* Clustering co-efficient of address<br />
* Pearson co-efficient<br />
* Bitcoin Circulation<br />
* Maximal Balance with respect to Address<br />
* Most active entity<br />

##### What type of data do you require from the database, on which blockchain?
The data of bitcoin address(input/output) and transaction based on amount are required for the analysis of bitcoin blockchain

##### What will be your results about? Addresses, transactions, blocks, clusters, etc.?
The result would be the graph metric based on address(input/ output), transactions 

##### Are your results time dependent? A time dependent result is valid for a specific time period. For example, degree centrality of an address can be computed daily.
Yes, it is time dependent for analysis for bitcoin circulation, maximal balance and the most active entity at a particular time.

##### What do we need to store from your results? (for example, the fact that “address a appears in the same cluster with address b” can be stored). 
Need to store details of the transaction  in order to the clustering co-efficient, bitcoin in circulation, Maximal Balance(address), The most active entity.

##### What are your findings that can be visualized by the visualization group? 
The visualization group need to visualize the clustering co-efficient, Pearson co-efficient, Bitcoin circulation, maximal balance(address), most active entity.

##### Can your results be used as input in algorithms of other groups? (this estimate will be updated after you see algorithms that are being implemented by others)
Our results will be used by the visualization team and may be used by influence team
