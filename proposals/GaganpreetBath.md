# What is your group, what are your considered articles?

- Influence
- Mint Centrality: A Centrality Measure for the Bitcoin Transaction Graph
- Entropic Centrality for non-atomic Flow Networks

# What is the aim in your project? What algorithms will you implement?

- The goal of my project is to implement a set of algorithms each of which will take the blockchain data, and output the Mint Centrality and Entropic Centrality to find    the important addresses and Vertices.


# What type of data do you require from the database, on which blockchain?

- The bitcoin or Etherium blockchain data, with nodes connections and their transfer amount.

# What will be your results about? Addresses, transactions, blocks, clusters, etc.?
- The result would be about addresses and transcations which are used to describe the centrality of a node in a graph.

# Are your results time dependent? A time dependent result is valid for a specific time period. For example, degree centrality of an address can be computed daily.
- No, the results are not time dependent.

# What do we need to store from your results? (for example, the fact that “address a appears in the same cluster with address b” can be stored).
- There will be outputs of different centrality measures per address or vertice.

# What are your findings that can be visualized by the visualization group?
- Visualization group can use these new methods of finding centrality to visualize the effects of bitcoin mixing, and characterize vertices which are
  important in the sense that there is a high uncertainty about the destination of an atomic flow starting at them.

# Can your results be used as input in algorithms of other groups? (this estimate will be updated after you see algorithms that are being implemented by others)
- No, these results cannot be used as inputs for other algorithms.
