# Individual Project Proposal 
##### -Kevin Tran (7802106)

##### What is your group, what are your considered articles?
The group - Anomaly Detection <br />
Articles :<br />
* The Anatomy of a Cryptocurrency Pump-and-Dump Scheme, Xu., Livshits.<br />

##### What is the aim in your project?
> The aim of the project is to build a model that predicts the pump likelihood of all coins listed in a crypto-exchange prior to a pump :<br />

##### What type of data do you require from the database, on which blockchain?
> The data of bitcoin address(input/output) and transaction based on amount are required for the analysis of bitcoin blockchain

##### What will be your results about? Addresses, transactions, blocks, clusters, etc.?
> The result would be the likelihood of a given coin will be pumped. 

##### Are your results time dependent? A time dependent result is valid for a specific time period. For example, degree centrality of an address can be computed daily.
> Yes, it is time dependent because the result for predicting the pumped coins needs to be provided before the pump event actually happens.

##### Can your results be used as input in algorithms of other groups? (this estimate will be updated after you see algorithms that are being implemented by others)
> Our results could be used by the visualization team
